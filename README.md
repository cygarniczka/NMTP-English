Bugged nonplayable Alpha. Requires BGT. Not compatible with EE version. 

Feel free to take over the translation project. Some dialogue needs to be fixed because it doesn't make sense but you shouldn't have 
problem interpreting what sentence would fit in the conversion. It's not easy to interpret Simplified Chinese into English by using google translate alone.

You need original mod from https://trow.cc/board/showtopic=16579 here. I think you need to register but not sure.

Buggs and CTDs:

-I don't know if I messed something up or is the original mod bugged itself. I didn not touch any files beside .tra and SETUP-NMTP.TP2 by adding (3 lines) English installation option

-Game CTD when sentenced to serve time by Flaming Fist Enforcer. 

-Trail by Amnish Soldier completely doesn't work - dialogs don't want to fire up.
